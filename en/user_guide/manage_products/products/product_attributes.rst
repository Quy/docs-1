General

-----------
Information
-----------

* **Name**—the name of the product as it appears on the storefront and in the Administration panel. The name of the same product can differ, depending on the storefront and language.

* **Categories**—the categories that the product will be assigned to. When a product has multiple categories, the first category on the list will be the main category for the product. To change the main category, just drag another category in its place.

* **Price**—base product price in your store's primary currency. Prices in other currencies are converted automatically, according to the exchange rate that you specify. All calculations are done in the primary currency.

* **Full description**—the product description that will appear on the product details page of the storefront. The description can be either a plain text or a formatted HTML text. If you're not familiar with HTML code, you can rely on the visual editor: you simply edit product description like a document, and the visual editor adds the HTML code automatically.

  .. hint::

      You can choose or disable the visual editor under **Settings → Appearance → Default WYSIWYG editor**.

* **Status**—the status of the product:

  * *Active*—the product is available on the storefront and appears in the product list.

  * *Disabled*—the product is not available on the storefront.

  * *Hidden*—product does not appear in the product list on the storefront. Customers can reach a hidden product via a direct link.

* **Store**—the storefront to which the product is assigned.

* **Images**—the images of the product. Supported formats are JPEG, GIF, and PNG. The maximum size of an uploaded image depends on your server configuration. As a rule, it should not exceed 2 MB. Thumbnails for these images will be generated automatically.

  One of the uploaded images will appear larger than the others. That's the main product image that is displayed on the product list and on the product details page by default. To change the main image, simply drag and drop another image in its place. You can also change the order of additional images the same way.

  If you hover over an image, you'll be able to view the full-sized image, delete it, or edit its alt text. This text will be shown when the image is missing or cannot be displayed. It is a good practice to have an alternative text associated with the image, for SEO purposes.

----------------
Options Settings
----------------

* **Options type**—select how the options and variants of this product appear and work on the storefront: 

  * *Simultaneous*—customers can choose the variant for each option independently and in any order.

  * *Sequential*—options and variants are chosen one after another: first the variant of the first option, then the variant of the second option, and so on.

  .. hint::

      Options are specific properties of the product that a customer can choose when making a purchase. For example, options for clothes may include color and size. The variants of those options would be *red/green/blue* and *S/M/L/XL/XXL* respectively.

* **Exceptions type**—select a type of the product option exceptions: 

  * *Forbidden*—you'll be able to specify *Forbidden combinations* on the **Options** tab. Customers won’t be able to purchase a product when they choose a forbidden combination of option variants.

  * *Allowed*—you'll be able to specify *Allowed combinations* on the **Options** tab. Customers will only be able to select these combinations of option variants.

-------------------
Pricing / Inventory
-------------------

* **CODE**—the identifier of the product that you use in your store (a stock keeping unit or SKU); it is used to distinguish products from each other during import, so that the data would be saved to the right product.

* **List price**—if this price is higher than product's **Price**, then a discount label will be displayed for the product.

* **In stock**—the number of products in the stock. Products that are out of stock can't be bought, unless you enable the **Allow negative amount in inventory** setting under **Settings → General → Catalog**.

* **Zero price action**—determines what can be done on the storefront when the product's price is 0:

  * *Do not allow customers to add the product to cart*

  * *Allow customers to add the product to cart*

  * *Ask customers to enter the price* — customers will see an input field and will be able to enter the price that they're willing to pay. That's useful for charity events or donations.

* **Inventory**—the way of tracking the inventory of the current product: 

  * *Track*

  * *Do not track*

  .. note::

      If a product is tracked with options, you'll need to specify the number of in-stock items individually for each combination of option variants.

* **Minimum order quantity**—the minimum number of items that a customer can buy at a time. This number will appear on the product page on the storefront, right after the product price.

* **Maximum order quantity**—the maximum number of items that a customer can buy at a time. *0* means no limit.

* **Quantity step**—determines the step by which a customer can increase or decrease the number of products in cart.

  .. hint::

      If the minimum order quantity is 3, the maximum order quantity is 9, and the quantity step is 3, then a customer will be able to purchase 3, 6, or 9 items in one order.

* **List quantity count**—the maximum number of choices in the **Quantity** drop-down list. It comes useful when you set a quantity step and when there are a lot of items in stock.

* **Taxes**—select the :doc:`taxes <../../shipping_and_taxes/index>` that will be applied to the product.

------------
Availability
------------

* **User groups**—the :doc:`user groups <../../users/user_groups/index>` that can access the product's page.

* **Creation date**—the date when the product was added to the catalog. It is used for sorting products by date.

* **Avail since**—the date when the product becomes available for purchase. It is useful when you want to start selling at a specific date, or when the product isn't available yet.

* **Out-of-stock actions**—select if customers should be able to buy the product in advance before it is not yet available for sale, or sign up to receive an email notification when the product is available.

      For this checkbox to appear, go to **Settings → General → Catalog** and tick the **Enable selling downloadable products** checkbox.

Shipping Properties

This tab contains a number of product properties that are important for automatic shipping cost calculation.

* **Weight**—the weight of a single item in the store's default weight measurement unit. The default weight measurement unit can be specified under **Settings → General**.

Quantity Discounts
==================

This tab contains the list of wholesale prices for the product. Customers will see those discounts on the product page on the storefront. Prices apply depending on the number of items of this product in cart.

Each file has the following properties:

* **Name**—the name of the file as your customers will see it on the product page. Note that it does not change the original file name.

* **Position**—the position of the file relatively to the positions of the other files in the list.

Subscribers
===========

.. important::

    This functionality has nothing to do with **Marketing → Newsletters → Subscribers**, which is a part of the :doc:`Newsletters <../../addons/newsletters/index>` add-on.

When a product is out of stock, you may allow customers to subscribe for an email notification. It will be sent automatically to inform the customers that the product is available again.

Each product has its own list of email addresses, available on the **Subscribers** tab. When a product is in stock again, the notification is sent to all subscribers, and then their emails are removed from the subscriber list of the product.

As you can see, the process is entirely automated. However, you can add subscribers manually, if necessary.

.. hint::

    More information about product subscribers is available in :ref:`the dedicated article <product-subscribers>`.
